## Move, Borrow, Mutate, or What

Make me compile! Don't change anything except the function's arguments.

<div class="hint">
<code>fn get_last_char</code> shouldn't take ownership, use reference for borrowing there.
</div>

<div class="hint">
<code>fn uppercase_and_print</code> should take ownership and mutates the variable.
</div>
